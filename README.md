## About   

  

This is a simple Memory Game Web Application created for my MS2 project with Code Institute. The game is designed to test a user's memory and is made up of a deck of cards, each card containing an image assigned randomly.

 ## Challenge
 
 The challenge is to match all the cards in as little time as possible, making the fewest selections possible

*** 

## Instructions

* Click on a card

* Continue revealing cards and working your memory to remember each unveiled card.

* Match cards properly with less moves and in faster time

 ***

## Game Layout

The game is made up of a single page containing a header, a score panel that keeps tabs of performance indicators such as the time, the number of moves and the current star rating of the user, depending on the performance, and also contains the reset button.

The game board is made up of a deck div containing 16 cards which were created dynamically in javascript. Each card consists of a front face and a backface. On card hover, the card background lightens upslightly, and on card click, the card flips 180 degrees and reveals the image behind it, which the user then needs to memorise to improve performance. The colour palette of my choice consisted of a green & black vector background, and cards that have an image of a vector cartoon animal to convey a more "game" feel, as well as careful choice of multi-coloured vector icons on the backface of the cards to ensure a colour diversity while maintaining a three-coloured theme.
